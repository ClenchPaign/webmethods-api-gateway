The `apigateway-dockerhub-template.yaml` is an OpenShift template that is comprised of the artifacts needed to deploy a simple API Gateway with embedded ElasticSearch:
* DeploymentConfig
* Service
* ImageStream
* Routes

The template also provides parameters, for example to easily change the name of the deployment.

More details are described in [this article](http://techcommunity.softwareag.com/pwiki/-/wiki/Main/API%20Gateway%20meets%20OpenShift).
