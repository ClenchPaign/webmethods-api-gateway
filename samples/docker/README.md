Docker is an open-source technology that allows users to deploy applications to software containers. A Docker container is an instance of a Docker image, where the Docker image is the application,
including the file system and runtime parameters.

You can create a Docker image from an installed and configured API Gateway instance and then run the Docker image as a Docker container. To facilitate running API Gateway in a Docker
container, API Gateway provides a script to use to build a Docker image and then load or push the resulting Docker image to a Docker registry.

Support for API Gateway with Docker 18 and later is available on Linux and UNIX systems for which Docker provides native support.

For details on Docker and container technology, see [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com)
